### Important information

If you are thinking of contacting us, please do not e-mail the author to ask for download instructions, installation guidelines, or the simulator itself. The simulator itself is well-documented and provides the essential information about the code. Note that we will NOT help to debug user-generated code that was not included in the provided software package. If, however, you notice a bug in our code, please be so kind to contact the Author.

The software package is supplied "as is," without any accompanying support services, maintenance, or future updates. We make no warranties, explicit or implicit, that the software contained in this package is free of error or that it will meet your requirements for any particular application. It should not be relied on for any purpose where incorrect results could result in loss of property, personal injury, liability or whatsoever.

### How to set up the simulation environment

Download all the scripts and folders you can find in this project as they are needed for a smooth execution.

### How to start a simulation

Navigate in Matlab to the directory containing the TAP_multipleScattering.m script.

Open

```sh
TAP_multipleScattering.m
``` 

and simply run the code (F5). Scenario numbering coincides with figure numbering in [A].
